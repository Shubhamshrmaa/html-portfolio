<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Shubham, an aspiring developer based in India. Although I didn’t attend college, I’ve always been passionate about technology and coding. 
  To pursue my career in tech, I took a proactive approach and used udemy to learn programming.
  I started with foundational courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then went on to practice alot.
  <br>
  <br>
  I recently completed udemy’s Full-Stack developer course, which provided me with hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.
  In addition to coding, I love hiking and exploring the beautiful trails around my place in Punjab. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I’m currently seeking an entry-level position where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer. 
  I’m particularly excited about joining a dynamic team that values continuous learning and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks for being here.

  Ciao!</p>
